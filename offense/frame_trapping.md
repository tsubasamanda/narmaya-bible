# Frame Trapping

Narmaya's ability to frame trap opponents is considered to be one of the best in the game due to her ability to layer multiple frame traps on top of each other while representing other options, preventing her opponent from trying to mindlessly mash out of her offense. This section will focus on how to use her tools to set these up and discourse your opponent from mashing.

## The Big Three

Narmaya has three effective plus-on-block normals that she can link together in many ways to discourage the opponent from mashing.

### 5L[k] and 5L[g]

Narmaya's 5L in Kagura stance is considered to be one of the best in the game, due to its speed, range, and frame advantage. On hit, it can be linked into another 5L[k] or c.M[k] to confirm into a full combo. On block, it is +4 (+5 at max range) which allows her to continue her pressure after.

### 2M[k]
