# Frame Trapping

Narmaya's ability to frame trap opponents is considered to be one of the best in the game due to her ability to layer multiple frame traps on top of each other while representing other options, preventing her opponent from trying to mindlessly mash out of her offense. This section will focus on how to use her tools to set these up and discourse your opponent from mashing.

## The Big Three

Narmaya has three effective plus-on-block normals that she can link together in many ways to discourage the opponent from mashing. These should be the bread-and-butter of your blockstrings.

### 5L[k] and 5L[g]

Narmaya's 5L in Kagura stance is considered to be one of the best in the game, due to its speed, range, and frame advantage. On hit, it can be linked into another 5L[k] or c.M[k] to confirm into a full combo. On block, it is +4 (+5 at max range) which allows her to continue her pressure after.

Genji stance's 5L also has similar utility, but is considered slightly worse due to its slightly slower speed, less range, and slightly less frame advantage. However, 5L[g]'s access to Genji specials gives her more options for [resetting pressure]({{site.baseurl}}/offense/resets.html).

These moves frame trap into almost anything.

### 2M[k]

This is one of the few plus-on-block mediums in the game, and it allows her to continue to maintain frame advantage as she gets pushed out of 5L range. Outside of c.L range for most characters, it frame traps into itself until you get pushed out of its range, at which point you need to make a decision about how to continue your pressure.

Once you are pushed out of 2M[k] range, you can frame trap with 2M[g] or f.H[k]. 2M[g] is a much tighter string and is usually recommended for this purpose.

### 66L

Narmaya's 66L is mostly used as a pressure starter/reset, but due to it being +2 on block, it is generally the start of your blockstrings, and will frame trap into both 5Ls at close ranges or 2M[k] outside of throw range.

There is much more information about this move in the sections on [resetting pressure]({{site.baseurl}}/offense/resets.html) and [neutral]({{site.baseurl}}/neutral/).

## Other useful moves

The three moves mentioned above are notable for being plus on block, allowing you to start and continue sequences of frame traps, but Narmaya's other normals can be useful for converting off of them.

### c.H[g]
Close H in Genji stance is a notable tool for frame traps for a few reasons. It frame traps after 5L[k] outside of throw range, and has high counterhit reward. It's also much safer to use as a frame trapping tool due to its ability to be cancelled into 236H[g] to maintain frame advantage.

### c.H[k]
The other side of the coin. The counterhit reward for this move is much higher than c.H[g] due to its ability to link into itself on counterhit, but due to it being a Kagura stance normal it doesn't have the ability to cancel into safe pressure resets, and will end your turn or require you to take risks to keep your turn if the opponent blocks it.

### 2M[g]
As mentioned earlier, this move can be used to frame trap opponents as they slip outside of 2M[k] range. It is much safer than other options due to being only -3 on block (with the option to cancel to 236H[g]) and having a shorter total duration than her other options at that range.

### f.M[g]
This is another option for frame trapping eager opponents at farther ranges, with slightly longer range than 2M[g].
