# Offense

Narmaya has incredible layered offense that will have your opponent pulling their hair out if executed correctly. This section will focus on all of the techniques you can use to punish your opponent in different ways.

This section is split into 4 different parts, representing 4 unique layers of offense that can be represented to condition your opponent into specific behaviors. You can find success in offense using only 1 or 2 parts, but being able to use and switch between all of them will take your offense to the next level.
