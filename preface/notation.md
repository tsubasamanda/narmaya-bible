# Notation

This page describes how moves are notated throughout this guide.

## Numpad Notation

This guide assumes you are familiar with numpad notation for fighting games, and will use it to describe normals and special moves.

## Stances

This guide uses the Dustloop convention for specifying Narmaya's stances.

1. Genji (Dawnfly), is the stance represented by a pink butterfly, and the stance Narmaya starts each round in. When a move is used in Genji stance, it will be labeled with the suffix [g].
2. Kagura (Freeflutter), is the stance represented by a blue butterfly. When a move is used in Kagura stance, it will be labeled with the suffix [k].

## Skybound Art

This guide uses a number of terms interchangably for Skybound Art, including:

1. Super
2. SBA (abbreviation for Skybound Art)

In general, Narmaya's Skybound Art and Super Skybound Art are pretty interchangable. Using Super Skyboard Art is generally preferred due to its higher damage and taking 2 BP from the opponent, however losing the corner may not be desirable due to Super Skybound Art's side switch.
